                  <p data-tagName="p" data-part="N">The Dream of the Rood, dating back to the first half of the 8th Century in
                     its earliest version, is one of the first Christian poems in the corpus of Old English
                     literature and one of the main examples of the genre of dream poetry in English. Due
                     to
                     its artistic qualities and overall relevance for Anglo-Saxon studies it is considered
                     one
                     of the most important achievements of Old English poetry; it is also one of the very
                     few
                     texts in this tradition that has been preserved in more than one witness. The complete
                     poem can be found in the late 10th Century Vercelli Book codex, but a fragment was
                     carved
                     in runes on the 8th Century Ruthwell Stone Cross (Dumfriesshire, Scotland), and a
                     small
                     excerpt can be found also on the Brussels Cross (St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral,
                     Brussels, Belgium), an Anglo-Saxon cross-reliquary of the early 11th century.

                  <p data-tagName="p" data-part="N">In the Vercelli Book the poem starts with the with the narrator having a dream: in
                     this
                     dream a wonderful object, which is later to be identified with the Holy Cross, stands
                     in
                     the air and tells the story of the crucifixion of Christ to the narrator.
